<h1>Saber Tooth Tiger</h1>
	<p>The most famous saber-toothed Tiger (Cat) is Smilodon; but it was only one genus of this amazing extinct animal. There are over a dozen other genera of this deadly animal.
	The various species ranged drastically in size. From Smilodon gracilis who weighed in at about 150 pounds (68 kilograms) to the massive Smilodon populator that roamed South America and could weigh as much as half a ton (454 kilograms).</p>
<h2>Saber Tooth Tiger Facts</h2>
	<P>Existing for about 42 million years, from the Eocene Epoch to the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, the last species died out about 10,000 years ago at the end of the earths last Ice Age.
	Where were these animals found? Species of these dangerous cats lived throughout the prehistoric world with their fossils being discovered on every continent with the exception of Australia and Antarctica.</P>
<h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
	<p>Like modern day big cats saber-tooth tiger had a strong built but much stockier than modern cats. It had short legs, short ears, and short feet. It had a short tail too. The cat had sharp claws powerful enough to rip off the flesh of prey.</p>
<h4>Behavior</h4>
	<p>Smilodon is a sit-and-wait predator and it only pounces when its prey is close enough.
	The structure of the bones tells us that saber tooth cat could roar in the same way as present day cats do. They used to fight over mates.</p>
<h5>Extinction</h5>
	<p>Saber tooth tiger had become extinct around 10,000 B.C. Apart from other causes for their extinction; prehistoric humans would have been supposedly responsible for the absolute extermination of Smilodon.
	Biologists believe that the arrival of ice age changed the vegetation pattern for these animals and could possibly cause extinction. Saber tooth tigers are not tigers at all; rather they are related to the family of tigers.</p>
<h6>Habitat</h6>
	<p>In their prime, saber-tooth tigers roamed the continents of North and South America, favoring the forests and grasslands,shrubby areas and pine forests where they could feed on large herbivores.
	Fossils in record suggested that they also lived in icy lands as they lived during the period which was the end of the Dinosaurs and during the Ice Age.</p>
